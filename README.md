# Simple Client/Server

This is an experiment with implementing simple client/server applications for Windows and Linux. Currently there are a few bugs. Built with mingw64 on Windows and g++ on Linux.

## Issues

- On Windows: both the client and server throw bad file descriptor errors when they try to read.

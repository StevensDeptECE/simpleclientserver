	IPV4Socket represents a socket connection that is portable between all platforms.
	The code must all be encapsulated in IPV4Socket.cc and hides any implementation details
	This implementation uses TCP/IP sockets.
	Eventually a corresponding class UDP4Socket will be written for faster Datagrams without
	acknowledgement and a guaranteed delivery system will have to be written on top of that.
	Header files are being moved to .cc so external code does not have to deal with the 
	large includes as well as the system specific nature of those includes
